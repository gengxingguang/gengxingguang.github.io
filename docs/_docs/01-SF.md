## Introduction

San Francisco is widely recognized as one of the most developed cities in the world and is a top tourist destination in the USA, attracting millions of visitors each year with its iconic landmarks, museums, cultural events, and scenic views. But San Francisco, like any city, has its share of crime and safety concerns. While it has a relatively high crime rate compared to other cities in the USA, which can have negative impacts on both the tourism industry and the safety of its residents.San Francisco's high crime rate is a complex issue that requires careful analysis and consideration. While the city has implemented various measures to improve public safety, including increasing police presence and community engagement, there are still several factors that contribute to the high crime rate. These include socio-economic disparities, drug use, and a large homeless population. Understanding these underlying issues is crucial to developing effective strategies to address crime and improve public safety in San Francisco.

Lets play the role of an analyst in a police station, as analysts in a police station, we can use data-driven approaches such as crime mapping and statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends, which can help inform policy decisions and resource allocation. Our work is essential in ensuring that San Francisco remains a vibrant and safe city for both its residents and visitors.

### Objectives


The objective of this study is to analyze the incidence of different types of crimes that have occurred in San Francisco in recent years. By using data visualization techniques, we aim to identify any noteworthy patterns and gain insightful information that can improve our understanding of crime trends. Ultimately, this study aims to help develop more effective strategies for crime prevention and control in the city.Our objective can be divided into following three parts:

- **Analyze the trend of crime incidents for each type of crime in recent years, and identify which types have consistently increased. This will allow us to focus on these particular crime types**
- **Utilize map visualization to analyze a specific type of crime**
- **Utilize interactive visualization in Bokeh to analyze a specific type of crime.**


## Data analysis
### Year Pattern

Within our dataset, we only focus on  16 distinct types of crime, which are `WEAPON LAWS` `PROSTITUTION` `DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE` `DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE` `ROBBERY` `BURGLARY` `ASSAULT` `DRUNKENNESS` `DRUG/NARCOTIC` `TRESPASS` `LARCENY/THEFT` `VANDALISM``VEHICLE THEF` `STOLEN PROPERTY` `DISORDERLY CONDUCT`. Our next step is to analyze the annual frequency of incidents that occurred between 2007 and 2018. By doing so, we can create visualizations that showcase the trends in the occurrence of each crime type over time.

Based on the plot above, it is evident that the number of `VEHICLE THEFT`,`LARCANY/THEFT` and `WEAPON LAWS` crimes has been consistently increasing every year, while the number of `PROSTITUTION`,`DISORDERLY CONDUCT`,and `DRUG/NARCOTIC` crimes has significantly decreased over time. Meanwhile, the number of other types of crimes has either been increasing or decreasing to varying degrees, but the overall trend has remained relatively stable. However, since this trend is not particularly relevant to our analysis,

Additionly, we have also observed a remarkable surge in `DRUNKENNESS` incidents in 2013, which raises questions about what may have caused this spike, as well as the reasons for the subsequent sharp decline in drug-related crime incidents in the following year. Further exploration of these phenomena is definitely warranted.

Since our objective today is to gain insights into why certain types of crimes are consistently increasing, we will focus our attention on the specific categories that have seen a rise in the number of incidents every year. As analysts at the police station, our aim is to leverage data analysis to understand the underlying factors driving these trends, in order to develop better strategies and allocate police resources more effectively.


Out of the categories we have analyzed, `VEHICLE THEFT`,`LARCANY/THEFT` and `WEAPON LAWS` have shown a consistent increase in the number of incidents over time. Among them, `LARCANY/THEFT` has exhibited a much more obvious upward trend than other types of crimes. This suggests that these types of crimes have not been effectively controlled, and their occurrences continue to rise every year. Reports indicate that leaving belongings in a car can result in theft within a matter of minutes, which further supports this trend. As both `LARCANY/THEFT` and `VEHICE THEFT` fall under the category of theft crimes, it is important to address this issue urgently to mitigate its impact on society. Just check out [this article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/09/multi-city-rash-of-car-break-ins-hits-the-bay-area/)

Therefore, let's focus solely on `LARCANY/THEFT` crimes in our analysis to better understand what occurred within this category and potentially gain some insightful findings.

### Map

 Our aim is to plot the location of each crime incident for each hour of the week and observe how these locations change over 168 hours. To achieve this, we must add a column to our dataframe that indicates the hour of the week in which each incident occurred.Additionally, we will only plot crime incidents that occurred in 2017 and 2018 since these two years are the most recent and have seen the highest number of crimes between 2007 and 2018. Moreover, we cannot plot all the incidents on the map as there are too many samples to visualize how they change over 168 hours.

After analyzing the map we created, it is evident that the western northern part of San Francisco, particularly the Central, Northern, Southern, and Mission districts, have the highest crime rates. One possible explanation for this trend is that these areas are located in the downtown part of the city, where there is a larger influx of people and higher population density. This creates more opportunities for criminal activity, which may explain the prevalence of crime in these districts.

Upon closer examination of the map, it becomes apparent that certain streets within these districts have a disproportionately high number of crimes. This could be due to the presence of popular tourist attractions, such as shopping centers and scenic spots, that attract large crowds and provide more opportunities for crime to occur.

We propose that additional police resources be allocated to these neighborhoods and streets in order to reduce criminal activity as a solution to this problem. In order to keep an eye out for suspicious activity, some possible strategies that could be used include stepping up foot patrols, setting up security cameras, and collaborating with nearby businesses. It is crucial to remember, however, that this strategy must be used cautiously to prevent potential drawbacks like excessive policing and strained community relations.

We find another interesting trend in the timing of crime incidents in San Francisco. Specifically, we have observed a sharp increase in the number of crimes occurring between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM each day, followed by a rapid decline after 10:00 PM. One possible explanation for this pattern is that the early evening hours are when the city experiences the highest influx of people, making it an opportune time for criminals to strike. However, after 10:00 PM, the number of people on the streets diminishes, reducing the likelihood of criminal activity.
Given this trend, we suggest that allocating additional police resources during the 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM timeframe may be an effective strategy for reducing crime rates during these peak hours.
